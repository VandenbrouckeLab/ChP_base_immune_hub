## Overview scripts

Here's an overview of the various R scripts used in processing the scRNA-Seq data in the manuscript Verhaege et al.:
- 1_script_LPS_kinetics_Bulk_RNAseq.R: edgeR-Limma workflow for processing LPS kinetics bulk RNA-seq data from adult ChP comparing all three timepoints (1h, 6h and 24h post-injection) individually with the untreated condition.
- 2_script_scRNAseq.R: Seurat workflow for processing scRNA-Seq data of adult mouse lateral and fourth ventricle ChP in naive and systemic inflammation conditions.
